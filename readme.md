# Portfolio Snapshot

This is a snapshot of my portfolio website, which you can find live at anna.elde.codes. 

In this repository, you'll find:

- A Django project located in ````./site````
- SCSS and JavaScript source code located in ````./src````
- Docker configuration located in ````./docker````
- Webpack configuration located in the root and ````./config/dev````
- A build/deployment script written in PowerShell at ````./build.ps1````

If you have any suggestions on ways I could improve my code, please do open an issue! I appreciate any input.

Thanks for checking this out! ðŸ˜Š
